wind farm,electricity,flooding,completed,FALSE,Tall wind turbines are typically not susceptible to flooding.
wind farm,electricity,earthquake,n/a,medium,"Wind turbines are vulnerable to earthquakes and to the vertical component of ground motion due to their
high frequency and relatively low damping."
wind farm,electricity,liquefaction,n/a,low,Wind turbines that are constructed on liquefiable soil can sustain damage.
wind farm,electricity,wind,completed,FALSE,Excessive wind speeds will cause cut-out in output and decrease lifespan of turbine due to excessive stresses
thermal power plant,electricity,flooding,completed,TRUE,
thermal power plant,electricity,earthquake,n/a,,Thermal power plants are susceptible to damage from peak ground acceleration (PGA).
thermal power plant,electricity,liquefaction,n/a,,
thermal power plant,electricity,wind,completed,TRUE,Assumed minimum wind speed design (i.e. lower standards)
hydropower plant,electricity,flooding,,TRUE,The key consideration is to avoid overtopping of the dam during extreme flooding.
